Here's how to cook a Cheesy Chicken Fajita Pasta:
1. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook spaghetti according to package directions until al dente. Drain.
2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Add chicken and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 6 minutes, then add onion and bell peppers and cook, stirring, until soft, 5 to 7 minutes more. Add spices and stir until coated.
3. Stir in tomatoes, broth, and half-and- half and simmer until slightly reduced, about 3 minutes. Add cooked spaghetti and toss until coated, then remove from heat, add cheeses, and stir until melty and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Garnish with cilantro before serving.
